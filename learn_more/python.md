# what is lifespan_wrapper in python
- From gpt
- In Python, the lifespan_wrapper typically refers to a function or decorator used to manage the lifecycle (creation, use, and destruction) of an object, task, or resource within a specific scope. This wrapper can help ensure that resources are properly initialized and cleaned up after use.
- It is often used in frameworks like FastAPI, where lifespan management is required for things like database connections or background tasks. For example, in FastAPI, the lifespan function is used to define what happens during the application startup and shutdown phases.
