# stdio_server
- is an asynchronous context manager that provides a standard input/output (stdio)-based transport layer for communicating with an MCP (Model Context Protocol) client. It facilitates bidirectional communication by reading JSON-RPC messages from stdin and writing JSON-RPC messages to stdout
- Stdio-Based Communication:
    - Enables communication between an MCP server and client using the process's standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout).
- Bidirectional Transport:
    - Client → Server: Reads JSON-RPC messages from stdin and sends them to the server.
    - Server → Client: Writes JSON-RPC messages from the server to stdout.
- Stream Abstraction:
    - Provides read_stream and write_stream for handling incoming and outgoing messages, abstracting away the low-level details of stdin and stdout.
## Arguments
- stdin
- stdout
## stdin_reader
- Reads lines from stdin asynchronously.
- Parses each line as a JSON-RPC message using model_validate_json.
- Sends valid messages to read_stream_writer.
- Sends exceptions (e.g., parsing errors) to read_stream_writer for error handling.
## stdout_writer
- Reads messages from write_stream_reader asynchronously.
- Serializes each message to JSON using model_dump_json.
- Writes the serialized JSON to stdout and flushes the output.
## Actions
- Re-Wrapping stdin and stdout
    - Ensures that stdin and stdout are wrapped as UTF-8 encoded asynchronous text streams.
    - Handles platform-specific quirks (e.g., Windows encoding issues).
- Create In-Memory Streams
    - read_stream and read_stream_writer:
        - Used for client-to-server communication.
        - Messages read from stdin are written to read_stream_writer and read from read_stream.
    - write_stream and write_stream_reader:
        - Used for server-to-client communication.
        - Messages written to write_stream are read from write_stream_reader and sent to stdout.
- Run Readers and Writers in a Task Group
    - Starts the stdin_reader and stdout_writer coroutines in an anyio task group.
    - Yields read_stream and write_stream to the calling code, allowing it to interact with the streams.
